    /**
     * @brief A synchronization primitive for read-mostly / striped-write scenarios.
     *
     * rw_sync implements a "Distributed Counter" or "Striped Locking" pattern, similar to
     * Scalable Read-Write Locks or Epoch-based Reclamation (EBR) mechanisms.
     *
     * Key Characteristics:
     * - Optimized for frequent, parallel writers (acquisition) and infrequent readers/flushers.
     * - Uses per-thread (or striped) atomic counters to eliminate cache-line contention (false sharing)
     *   on the write path, which is critical for high-throughput memtable insertions.
     * - A centralized atomic (_frozen) acts as a gatekeeper.
     *
     * Usage Contract:
     * - The user MUST guarantee that this_thread_idx is valid (< thread_count).
     * - While safe for multiple threads to share a slot (aliasing) due to internal ref-counting,
     *   performance is optimal when each thread has a unique, stable slot index.
     *
     * Memory Ordering:
     * - Uses seq_cst to enforce a strict Store-Load barrier between the writer announcing
     *   presence (increment counter) and checking the gate (load frozen). This prevents a race
     *   where a flusher could freeze and destroy the object while a writer is still entering.
